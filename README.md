# VerificationBot
Verification Bot is a bot enabling server owners to verify members from their Discord Servers on other Discord Servers

# About
Welcome to Verification Bot. the bot made by Matto MC#3158 (DO NOT DM ME IF YOU NEED HELP COME TO THE MAINBOT DISCORD SERVER) http://discord.mainbot.xyz

Verification Bot is here for server owners to configure this to their likings and enable members from their Discord server to be verified on other Discord Sevrers. The main idea of Verification bot was from my FiveM community, You should join if you want https://udfgaming.com members from that discord can go to any server the UDF External Verification is in and type the command !verify (! = Prefix). the prefix for your bot will be customizable. And the bot will see if your ID is in the servers API list or JSON file and if it is it gives you the role defined in the config.json that was given to you by the staff at MainBot.

And again as Main Bot. the source code will not be in here

# Setting up the bot
First of all make a new Discord app or if you want it hosted by Matto MC or the MainBot team we will be willing to provide you with one. 

1. change the name of the example-config.json to config.json
2. edit the fields in the config.json to match your Server ID and your role name. Please note that the role name needs to match
3. Add the bot to your own server and make sure the role of the bot is above the role that the bot will give out. Here is a example link to add the bot: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=INSERTIDHERE&scope=bot&permissions=8
4. start a terminal window or cmd window and type the command npm i
5. Start the bot
6. Any addition help can be provided at the MainBot Discord Server http://discord.mainbot.xyz
